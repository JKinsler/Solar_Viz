# SolarViz

SolarViz is a full stack web application that informs users about solar energy production and news.

SolarViz has a custom web interface that displays data from the California Solar Initiative, which is an energy tracking and incentive program run by the state. The site contains dynamically generated graphs that users can review to understand broad trends in solar energy production. Users can select filters on the broader data set to see specific information from years and companies. 

SolarViz also displays current news related to solar energy and utilities. Users can see article descriptions and click them to go to the original news source. 

This project was made at Hackbright Academy in San Francisco over four weeks in February and March 2020.
