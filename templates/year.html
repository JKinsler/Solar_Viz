  <h4>About the data</h4>
  <p>Read this page to see how solar energy generation and total energy consumption compare for three major California energy utilities. You'll notice that much more energy is consumed than generated by solar. The remaining portion of energy comprises a mix of renewable, fossil fuel, and nuclear sources. This website only shows the California CSI working data, but you can.

  The graphs and tables on this page show CSI data specifically from {{year}}. Try visiting different years to see how they compare.

    The table above shows the comparison of the total energy used with the amount of solar energy generated in {{year}}. This table shows the sum total from all utilities that participated in CSI. The participating utilities are:
    <a href="https://www.pge.com/">Pacific Gas and Electric</a>,
    <a href="https://www.sdge.com/">San Diego Gas and Electric</a> and,
    <a href="https://www.sce.com/">Southern California Edison</a>.
